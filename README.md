Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site.


## Description

As a retailer in e-commerce, I want to make my job easier. Creating a database will allow me to interact with my products and track my inventory.
I learned how to use MySQL and API's to make this project. Utilizing routes for the databases was a challenge, but developed new skills.

## Installation

You will have to clone this and use your own MySQL login to run it.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
